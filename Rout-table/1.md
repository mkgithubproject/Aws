Exactly ✅ — you are correct. Let’s clarify fully so it sticks.

## 🔹 Route Table in VPC

* **Purpose:** Determines **where outgoing traffic from a subnet goes**.
* **Outbound only** — it does **not control inbound traffic**.
* **Inbound traffic** is controlled entirely by:

  1. **Security Groups (SG)**
  2. **Network ACLs (NACLs)**

---

### 🔹 Example

**Subnet:** Public Subnet
**Route Table:**

| Destination | Target |                        |
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| 10.0.0.0/16 | local  | ← internal VPC traffic |
| 0.0.0.0/0   | IGW    | ← internet traffic     |

**Outbound flow:**

* EC2 → IP 10.0.1.5 → uses **local route** → reaches EC2 in same VPC
* EC2 → 8.8.8.8 → uses **0.0.0.0/0 → IGW** → reaches Internet

**Inbound flow:**

* Someone tries to SSH to EC2’s public IP → route table **does nothing**
* Allowed only if **Security Group and NACL allow inbound traffic**

### 🔹 Analogy

| Component   | Role                                      |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Route Table | GPS for outgoing delivery trucks          |
| IGW         | Highway to leave the building             |
| SG/NACL     | Security guards controlling who can enter |

* Trucks leaving: **follow route table → IGW → Internet**
* Visitors entering: **only allowed by guards (SG/NACL)**

---

### 🔹 Quick Memory Tip

> **Route Table = outbound paths only**
> **Inbound = controlled by Security Groups & NACLs**

---

If you want, I can draw a **full VPC traffic flow diagram** showing clearly:

* Outbound via route table + IGW/NAT
* Inbound controlled by SG/NACL

It will make everything crystal clear.

Do you want me to do that?
